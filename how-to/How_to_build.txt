Building the iso

Make sure that you have the package archiso installed on your system.

You must build from an Arch, x86_64 system.

Clone the archlabs-iso repo onto your system. 
git clone https://github.com/archlabs/archlabs-iso

Make a directory to build the iso in. It can be in your home directory,
it's just a place to work. 
I usually just make a directory called archlabs-iso in my home folder. 


You need to move the entire "archiso" folder into the new directory that you made,
but it is very important that you do it as root. Every file needs to be owned by "root". 
You can do this by opening a file manager as root. Or from the command line. 

If you cloned the repo in your Downloads folder, and then made a working directory called
archlabs-iso, the command would look like this
sudo cp -r ~/Downloads/archlabs-iso/archiso ~/archlabs-iso/

In the archiso folder, there is a file called packages.both.
This file is a list of packages that will be included in the iso.
You can add or remove items from this list for them to be included or removed.

The packages.i686 and packages.x86_64 are irrelevant unless you wanted to build in multiple
architectures. 

The efiboot isolinux and syslinux folders contain the files for configuring the boot
of the iso. If you want to change the background of the boot screen of the iso or any of the
entries you can do it by making the changes to the files in the syslinux folder. I'd leave
the efiboot folder alone, as well as the isolinux folder.


The pacman.conf file that is in the archiso directory is the pacman.conf that is used only when 
building the iso. If you open the file, at the bottom there is the entry to the archlabs repo. 

You will need to clone the archlabs repo to your local system.
git clone https://github.com/archlabs/archlabs-repo

Then you need to change the line in the pacman.conf file to match where the repo is located on your system. For example, if you cloned the repo in the root of your home directory, the 
entry should look like this:

[archlabs-repo]
SigLevel = Optional TrustAll
Server = file:///home/<username>/archlabs-repo/$arch

The only line you should have to change is the "Server = file.///home/<username>/archlabs-repo/$arch"
Obviously, <username> would be your username. 

In the airootfs folder is the file system. 

That is where you can add anything that you want to the iso. Remember, everything must be
done as root, so if you add something, do it as root or by using sudo.

When everything is added, go back to the archiso directory. You will see a script called
build.sh that is the build script. 

Before building, you will need to clean out the pacman cache. I know, nobody likes to do that,
but it avoids problems.
sudo pacman -Scc

Now just run sudo ./build.sh -v
the -v is verbose, so it will show you more output. 

When it's finshed, there will be a directory called out, and the iso will
be in there. 

I know that I'm missing stuff, so feel free to ask questions.

Hope this helps. 



Adding AUR packages to the repo:

If you want to add a AUR package to the iso, you will first have to add it to the archlabs-repo.
To do this, just download the PKGBUILD from the aur. I usually click "download snapshot". 
Extract the tar file, and navigate into the extracted folder. Open a terminal there and run:
makepkg -s
This will build the package. You may get errors for other needed depencies. If you do, you will have to 
build those packages as well, and also add them to the repo.

When the packaged is finshed building, just move the <packagename>x86_64.pkg.tar.xz file (that is the actual
package) into the x86_64 folder in the archlabs-repo. Then just run the updaterepo.sh script that I put in
there.
That script will automate added the package to the repo database for you.

Now just add the package name to the "packages.both" file in the archiso folder of the archlabs-iso. 
 
That should do it!

Calamares

You will have to re-build calamares every so often. If the qt5 libraries update and don't 
match the calamares version, it won't run. I keep a package build updated (usually), so let me
know if you need it and I'll gladly share it. 

Just to explain how I configured calamares for ARCHlabs. 
calamres is very modular. Almost every function in the installer can be modified by changing 
or providing a module. I hard coded the theming modules insto the iso in ARCHlabs. It's the same
thing I do with OBR. So, if you want to change the slides, pictures, ect. You don't have to rebuild
the entire package. Just go into the iso source code and you will find the slides and brading stuff
in /etc/calamares within the iso. There are more configurations in /usr/lib/calamares.

I had to rewrite the main.py in the initcpio module, but just minor changes were needed in the
other modules.

I have no doubt that you guys can build the iso.
If you have questions, just let me know.
