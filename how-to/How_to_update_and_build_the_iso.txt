Scripts to assist us in various tasks


Scripts are there to take care of all repetitive tasks to create an iso like

	- getting latest info from Archlabs-Openbox-Config and putting it in skel
	- getting latest info from Archlabs-Conky-New-Syntax and putting it in skel
	- getting latest info from Archlabs-Tint2 and putting it in skel
	- creating an iso 



Setup in order to make an iso


Make a directory with the name "ARCHLABS" on your home directory.

Copy/paste the script "update-archlabs-gits-v1.sh" to it and run it. You will get all the archlabs githubs you need.
On a later date you can run it again and the script will update your local githubs.
IF you have changed something locally, remember to push it with ./git-vx.sh to the net.


Go inside the folder "scripts" and run one by one the scripts from small numbering to big.


The scripts assume that all githubs are in the same directory "ARCHLABS" and will get all updated information and put it in the archiso github.

You should update all githubs before building the iso!!
